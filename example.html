        video tool powered by
        AI technology, primarily designed to alter the
        content of videos to integrate organically with the user's real-life circumstances. For example, if it is
        raining where the user is located, Live Scape will change the weather in the video to match a rainy scene. What
        makes Live Scape unique is that the user doesn't need to manually set preferences such as weather, time, or
        personal tastes; all these elements are gathered and analyzed by the AI. Additionally, Live Scape will make more
        detailed adjustments to the video based on the user's situation, such as changing the characters' outfits or
        dialogue, to better align with the user's real-world context.</div>
